# np-database
A simple relational database programmed in C++

In an effort to test my knowledge of concepts I had learned in CS 165 in Oregon State University's computer science program, I decided to create my own database using only C++. This software uses most if not all of the skills learned in an intro to computer science class, up to and including algorithms and data structures.

There is a main class called Database, which uses vectors to store data from a User and Item class. Those two classes act as tables in a conventional database, and each contains its own set of variables, while the database class contains the methods to manipulate data. In this example, the data for each table is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file in that program's directory.

This is useful and simple design to help better understand how databases work, and the logic can be translated to any other language.
